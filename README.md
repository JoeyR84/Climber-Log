This is an app for keeping track of your workouts. It is built with Ruby on Rails 5 and React 16. They are integrated wih the `react-rails` gem. I built this to practice Rails and start learning React. Use rails serve if you want to get this thing running and check it out. The form for submitting new workouts and the table that shows old workouts is built with React. The development confirmation email does not send (production works) so you have to change confirmed to true in the terminal.
